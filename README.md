# WeddingLetters
A Program to quickly write letters for my sisters wedding.

My sister has a wedding with 270 people coming just from her side alone.

As a wedding gift, I wanted to make their wedding cards significantly easier to write.

Currently, this program takes a list of guests imported from a JSON file that I created.

The guests have their name and gift as a dictionary entry. If the guest didn't give a gift, a card is written for them in the same format.

To see the difference, download my guestDictionary.txt file and weddingThankYou.txt files and run the program.

Check out PeteyAtes.txt (my dog!) and LexiEaster.txt, and take note of the difference for situations where a gift is given(Lexi) and not given (Petey).

Lastly, the program creates an HTML file so that I can style the letters with CSS and print them out on letterhead.

If you open the HTML file in a browser, take note that the full name at the top is only there for testing purposes.
